# Enigma Simulator Application


## Introduction
The Enigma Simulator is a software implementation of the Enigma machine, originally used by Germany during World War II for encrypting and decrypting messages. 
The Enigma machine works by passing the message through several rotors and a plugboard, each of which changes the message in a specific way. 
The purpose of this simulator is to replicate that process, allowing users to configure the machineâ€™s settings and encrypt or decrypt messages based on those settings.

- The simulator allows the user to:
- Select and configure rotors.
- Set initial rotor positions.
- Configure ring settings for each rotor.
- Set plugboard swaps.
- Choose a reflector (Reflector I or Reflector II).
- Encrypt and decrypt messages.
