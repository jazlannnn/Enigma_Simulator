# Enigma Simulator Application


## Introduction
The Enigma Simulator is a software implementation of the Enigma machine, originally used by Germany during World War II for encrypting and decrypting messages. 
The Enigma machine works by passing the message through several rotors and a plugboard, each of which changes the message in a specific way. 
The purpose of this simulator is to replicate that process, allowing users to configure the machine’s settings and encrypt or decrypt messages based on those settings.

For more detailed information about the history and mechanics of the Enigma machine, please refer to this article: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/831015/ENIGMA

The simulator allows the user to:
- Select and configure rotors.
- Set initial rotor positions.
- Configure ring settings for each rotor.
- Set plugboard swaps.
- Choose a reflector (Reflector I or Reflector II).
- Encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Conclusion
The Enigma Simulator replicates the functionality of the original Enigma machine, enabling users to encrypt and decrypt messages by 
configuring rotors, positions, ring settings, plugboard mappings, and reflectors. Through this interactive setup, the simulator demonstrates the complexity 
and effectiveness of Enigma’s layered encryption, illustrating how even small configuration changes yield vastly different encrypted outputs. 
This project not only highlights the historical importance of the Enigma machine but also provides an accessible way to understand fundamental encryption principles in cryptography.
